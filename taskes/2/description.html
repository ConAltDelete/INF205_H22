  Resource-efficient programming (INF205) lab u37: 15th September 2022

   Work on the below and submit 1) on [1]Google docs and 2, 3) through
   canvas.

   The recommendation is still to work together in the same groups in
   which you plan to collaborate for the INF205 programming project. For
   2, 3), one person submits individually on behalf of all group members;
   write somewhere who your group members are. For 1), comment
   anonymously.

    1. Module feedback and recommendations

   Help guide the module into the direction that suits you best as the
   specific group of learners and developers that you are. Create entries
   on the [2]feedback and recommendations document for this purpose.

   This can be about the topics, the format/form of presentation, the
   tutorial activities, etc. - anything related to this module. Some good
   practices about this include:
     * Write anonymously, and do not expose the identity of any other
       commenters if you happen to know who they are.
     * Contribute your own point of view independently and positively. Do
       not criticize others' comments, and always let them stand as they
       are.
     * Something along the lines "We did X, and we also did Y. We could
       use more of X, it could be at the expense of Y." will be easier to
       take up than "Just don't do any more Y."
     * Best connect to something that was done (or included in the
       outline) and that you would like to affirm. Propose where you would
       like to go with it, such as "X is among the more interesting
       elements. We could develop it into X'."
     * Include a very brief rationale as to why you are recommending
       something.

   You may need to logout from your Google account before commenting, or
   it will not be anonymous.

    2. Size of fundamental data types

   What outcome do you find from checking the size of the C++ fundamental
   data types on your own system, e.g., as done in the lecture
   ([3]datatype-size.cpp)? It will normally conform to [4]LLP64 under
   Windows and [5]LP64 otherwise.

    3. Performance measurement

   There are many ways to measure the runtime of a program, including
   "time" on the command line. Section 13.7 in the Stroustrup (2018)
   textbook introduces the following technique:
#include <chrono>

...
{ ... /* somewhere */
   auto t0 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
   do_the_work();
   auto t1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
   auto delta_t = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(t1-t0).c
ount();

   std::cout << "do_the_work() took " << 0.001*delta_t << " ms to run.\n";
   ...
}

   Run a performance scaling test, measuring the runtime as a function of
   n, for the lecture example from week 36, but using 8-byte integers
   (int64_t as below, or in accordance with your architecture as
   determined above):
bool is_prime(int64_t n)
{
   for(int64_t i = 2; n >= i*i; i++)
   {
      if((n % i) == 0) return false;
   }
   return true;
}

   Design your measurements intelligently in a way that at least allows
   for a discussion of average-case and/or worst-case time requirements.
   Do you find the runtime to scale with O(n^1/2) as expected?
