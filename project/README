Pixels to Circles

All our files are in the directory lib/, and the documentation is in docs/. The makefile in lib/ compiles everything.
The resulting files from running the program should be "image.pbm" and "circles.ps".
image_gen/ holds the tools to generate new images, and is the part of our project that uses manual memory allocation.
